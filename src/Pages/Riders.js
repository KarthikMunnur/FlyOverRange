                      <p>
                        Hello my name is Rebecca Kearns and I am an equestrian
                        major at Rocky Mountain College. When I began my search
                        for colleges I knew that my heart was set on horses and
                        I wanted to compete. When I came for a college tour I
                        met all the equestrian trainers and professors and fell
                        in love with all of them. They all made me feel welcomed
                        and supported along with seeing my potential and knowing
                        I can become the best rider I can be. Rocky Mountain
                        College is a smaller school which I also fell in love
                        with. I knew I wanted to create a relationship with my
                        trainers and professors rather than just be a number.
                        Everyone in the equestrian program makes me feel as if
                        this is my second home.

                        Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York. Serinah is from
                        Staten Island and rode on the MET IEA team with Jane
                        DaCosta who encouraged and mentored her. She earned a
                        significant scholarship for her undergraduate studies.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        At Hartwick she continued riding on the IHSA team. Her
                        first two years of competition were sidelined because of
                        COVID-19, but in 2022, Serinah qualified for and
                        competed at Regionals.

                        “Making it to Regional Finals was a dream come true,”
                        Serinah said. “I want to thank the IHSA for providing me
                        the opportunity to continue my riding career throughout
                        my academic college career, for creating countless
                        memories with teammates, meeting new people in and out
                        of the saddle, and reconnecting with former IEA
                        teammates while cheering them on. My favorite part of
                        IHSA is the family I found and all the amazing horses
                        I’ve learned from and come across. Without riding I
                        don’t think I’d be where I am today, so thank you!”

                          am today. IHSA has given me the opportunity to meet
                          new people and make new friends. I have made so many
                          memories and I have been very successful competing in
                          IHSA, but none of this would be possible without the
                          help and support from my teammates and my coach,
                          Conner Smith. My favorite IHSA memory was being apart
                          of Midway’s Western team region win in 2019-2020.
                          Although every IHSA show with my team is very
                          memorable, winning the region has to be my
                          favorite!&nbsp;

                        </strong>
                        Catch riding all types of horses—you never know what
                        horse you'll get! Discussing how to best ride each horse
                        and getting advice from all my teammates early in the
                        morning of a show always leaves me feeling reassured and
                        ready. Also having my teammates and coaches&nbsp;cheer
                        ringside as placings are called makes me feel like a
                        valued member of our team and IHSA as a whole.

                        </strong>
                        I have been on the Wisconsin Equestrian Team since my
                        first semester of freshman year. I have served on the
                        executive board since then and loved it—I am dedicated
                        to my teammates, coaches, and horses. College would be a
                        much tougher experience if I did not have the barn and
                        horses to escape to on a weekly basis. IHSA has let me
                        be a part of a group of people that are constantly
                        encouraging growth and supporting me inside and outside
                        of the ring, and I am so grateful for that.

                        connections I’ve made in the horse world with equine
                        professionals across the country and also the friends
                        I’ve made from many different schools. It’s a wonderful
                        showing experience that pulls in people from all walks
                        of life whether they’ve been showing forever or just
                        started in college. It also is a wonderful way to gain
                        experience riding many different horses of different
                        breeds. If it were not for the IHSA, I wouldn’t have
                        otherwise had the opportunity. IHSA has enhanced my
                        college experience immensely due to the head start of my
                        career in the horse world and the relationships I have
                        made. I want to thank IHSA because I have become a more
                        confident rider and student because of this
                        experience.&nbsp;

                        I am from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and I am
                        studying biochemistry and math on a pre-med track. I
                        brought my personal horses with me to school to balance
                        studying and my love of horses. My riding background is
                        mostly in starting young horses under saddle or riding
                        problem horses for people, which worked well because the
                        show ring gave me severe anxiety. Regretfully, I waited
                        until my senior year to join the IHSA team. I love
                        everything about it. My team is an amazing group of
                        people who love and support me. The show environment is
                        competitive but in a very fun and encouraging kind of
                        way. I cannot believe how much my confidence in the ring
                        grew through this experience. I competed in the novice
                        hunter seat division, and I jocularly became known as
                        the rider who looked for tight inside turns as a way to
                        spice up the course. Sometimes it worked and sometimes
                        it backfired, but I always had fun trying. I even made
                        friends from other schools and looked forward to seeing
                        them at the shows. I am overall just very thankful to
                        all who make IHSA possible because I will never forget
                        my season on the University of Scranton Equestrian Team.

                      I started riding nine years ago when my mom bought a
                      Quarter Horse for our family. I quickly got into a very
                      competitive environment. Not only did I love the animals,
                      but also the challenge of how much coordination, strength
                      and feel are required when maneuvering them. I have been
                      on the National Youth Team of Norway for four years, and
                      together we won Scandinavian Team Cups and placed second
                      in the European Team Cup. The highlight was in 2014 when
                      we placed 4th in the AQHA Youth World Cup in Texas. <br />
                      <br />I have always enjoyed being on a team where you have
                      people around you who support you and have your best
                      interests at heart. Also, you feel like you contribute to
                      something that is bigger than yourself. With that in mind,
                      I fell in love with the idea of being on a college
                      equestrian team. <br />
                      <br />
                      Making the move from Norway to North Carolina to study and
                      compete ISHA has been the best decision of my life. As an
                      IHSA rider you need to be confident in your abilities, yet
                      take nothing for granted. The most important thing I have
                      learned as an IHSA rider is to ride every stride with
                      confidence and feel. In the future, I wish to take this
                      ability and turn it into my profession, as I would love to
                      work as a horse trainer.

                        Before IHSA, most of my experience was in the hunter
                        ring, however, I do enjoy dressage and cross country.
                        When I was asked why I love IHSA, I could think of
                        million reasons why, but it’s harder to explain your
                        love for showing in one paragraph. I love riding in the
                        IHSA, not only because I am able to continue riding
                        throughout my academic career in college, but because
                        you can learn so much about yourself as a rider. Each
                        show and className presents a new horse and a new
                        challenge. You learn your strengths, how to improve upon
                        your weaknesses and even learn something you have never
                        known. And even when you are cheering your teammates on
                        from outside the ring, you are watching other riders
                        with such a wide range of skills. You can never stop
                        learning. <br />

                        that are encouraging and motivational. I think competing
                        for the IHSA is unique because we draw a horse that we
                        may have never ridden before. Then we compete on that
                        horse, for the opportunity to earn points for ourselves

                        I am currently a junior at Texas State. I started riding
                        horses at age 6 and got my first horse at age 12. She is
                        still my only horse and we’ve been together for 10
                        years. I mostly rode western (barrel racing/gymkhana)
                        but decided to try my hand at hunter seat when I moved
                        to Central Texas from Southern California last fall. I
                        have fallen head-over-tall-boots-heels in love with the
                        discipline! Thanks to the incredible coaching from Texas
                        State Equestrian’s coach Katherine Deichmann, I brought
                        home a couple primary-colored ribbons last season in the
                        Walk-Trot-Canter, advanced division. I loved being on
                        the team so much that I decided to run for captain, and
                        lo and behold, I was elected! I’m looking forward to the
                        2018/2019 year with Texas State Equestrian and IHSA. My
                        main goal is to point out of W/T/C and move up into the

                        I am from Madison, Alabama, and I am majoring in
                        Chemical Engineering at the University of Alabama. My
                        favorite thing about the IHSA is the unique challenge it
                        presents, because you can't become too used to riding
                        one horse. You have to learn to adapt and ride a horse
                        that you've never really interacted with before while
                        riding at a competitive level, which is difficult in and
                        of itself. That forces you to be more aware of not only
                        the horse you are riding, but also yourself. You can't
                        change the horse to fit your own riding style, but
                        instead, you have to fit your riding style to the horse
                        that you're on.

                      <p>
                        I began showing for St. Andrews University in 2014 as an
                        Intermediate rider. I enjoyed being a rider for the team
                        and went to Regionals, Semi-Finals, and Nationals as the
                        Intermediate team rider and placed 7th overall. In 2015,
                        I pointed up to Novice and began showing the Novice for
                        our team. I also qualified to show the Individual
                        Intermediate and went on to win Regionals, Semi-Finals,
                        and Nationals. In 2015, I also placed 4th in the Team
                        Novice at Nationals. In 2016, I pointed up to the
                        Advanced className and began showing the Advanced for
                        our team. Pointing up to the Advanced also qualified me
                        to compete in the Individual Novice. In 2016, I won
                        Regionals, Semi-Finals, and Nationals in the Individual
                        Novice. In 2017, I continued showing the Advanced and am
                        currently still showing in the Advanced className and
                        hope to keep excelling to compete in the Open. Showing
                        at St. Andrews University has taught me so much about
                        being a horseman, allowed me to meet many influential
                        individuals, and has also helped me to make some of my
                        dreams come true. None of the teams’ success could be
                        possible without Carla Wennberg or Lindsey Trockenbrot.
