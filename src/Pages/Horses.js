                    The IHSA community shares a passion for horses. IHSA coaches
                    and riders are grateful for all of the wonderful horses that
                    are the heart and soul of our sport. From the tried-and-true
                    lesson horse who teaches new riders, to the decorated show
                    horse who found a new career as part of a college program,
                    our horses are key to the success of the IHSA. Take a moment

                      <p>
                        Cardenfe, aka Carl, came to the United States Military
                        Academy in the summer of 2022. He is a big bay warmblood
                        gelding standing at 17.2h. He was donated to the Cadet
                        Equestrian Team by Moriah Bluman who was confident that
                        the academy would be a good fit for Carl.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And how right she was! Carl warmed our hearts from day
                        one. His barn manners are perfect, even though he
                        manages to get more hay outside of his stall then in it.
                        He prefers the more advanced rider but is tolerant of
                        the novice one.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Carl’s background is quite extensive. He has done the
                        U25 (1.45) level winning many classes. He has jumped
                        successfully in Europe, WEF in Wellington, Tryon,
                        Kentucky and Michigan to name a few. He has guided
                        riders from the low amateur jumpers (1.25) up through
                        the levels to U25 for over 10 years. Now at 18, his job
                        at the academy is much lighter and more suitable for
                        this very special boy.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Carl has competed at the Zone 3 Regional Championship,
                        thus proving him a worthy national competitor the
                        Nationals 2023 in Kentucky. He has proved to be a
                        favorite to the Army Equestrian Team as well as the
                        other riders in our region.

                        Easters Lil Chic, aka Mo, was purchased by Mississippi
                        State University in the spring of 2016 as a 2-year-old
                        show prospect and for its breeding program. Easters Lil
                        Chic is by AQHA Versatility Ranch Horse World Champion,
                        Lil Ruf Catalyst, out of Smart Easter Chic.&nbsp; Mo
                        excelled in Ranch Riding, qualifying for the AQHA World
                        Show in a single weekend, her first year of showing. She
                        then transitioned into a dynamite equestrian team horse
                        and broodmare. Producing foals by Zezes Pepto Cat,
                        Metallic Rebel, and two foals on the way by Cowpuncher
                        Cadillac. Mo has elevated the Mississippi State
                        University breeding program to the next level.

                      <p>
                        Mo’s greatest strength is her ability perform as a
                        member of the equestrian team. Whether it's reining,
                        ranch riding, horsemanship or equitation on the flat, Mo
                        is a competition favorite and has won nearly every class
                        she’s been shown in. She’s also participated in camps,
                        pony rides and extension activities. Mo is physically
                        talented with a great mind and is a wonderful teacher.

                        “Layla” is a 19-year-old warmblood mare who has been
                        part of the University of Illinois IHSA &nbsp;family
                        since 2008. Layla started her time with us as a hunter
                        prospect. At first, she was a bit of a handful but has
                        settled in and become a forever resident.

                      <p>
                        Layla believes herself to be a princess, but in her
                        years here has proven to be a workhorse. She can teach
                        all levels from Introductory to Open. She is quiet and
                        safe. She can make a student work hard to get
                        perfection. She has taught many young riders that if she
                        is not asked properly and politely all they will get is
                        mediocrity. She is really like riding a big, beautiful
                        pony.

                        Ido’s life had once been full of promise. He was a
                        well-bred Oldenburg destined for dressage stardom. The
                        gelding successfully navigated life up the ranks to
                        third level but his future was quickly shattered by what
                        was thought to be a career-ending injury. After a year
                        of efforts to regain his soundness with no success, Ido
                        was donated to a research program where he spent the
                        next several years in the field undergoing a study in
                        equine parvovirus. Unfortunately for Ido, at the study’s
                        end, he once again found himself in search of a new
                        place to call home. While uncertain of the role he would
                        play in her program, Cornell University&nbsp; team coach
                        Joanna Novakovic trusted her gut and took a chance on
                        the gelding. <br />
                        <br />
                        Ido took to the program quickly. He's great with all
                        levels of riders and he's a preferred pick at the shows,
                        in fact, he won his very first class.

                      Qlipper De Forets is a 17-year-old Selle Francais gelding
                      that was donated to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, by
                      Gregg and Evette DeLong of Encinitas, California, after a
                      career in the jumper ring. <br />
                      <br />
                      Just 15.3, Qlipper is a great confidence-builder with a
                      been-there-done-that attitude. He is a favorite of the
                      team and of head coach Heather Pinnick. Pinnick paired him
                      with IHSA member Tess Von Hemel and the pair showed in the
                      1.0m jumpers at nearby World Equestrian Center when IHSA
                      competition was slowed due to COVID. It was Von Hemel's
                      first foray into the jumpers and they did so well they
                      moved up to the 1.10/1.15 level. Together, they earned the
                      Zone 5 and 6 championship for the division at Great Lakes
                      Equestrian Festival. This was a first for a Miami
                      University horse and a great accomplishment for Von Hemel.
                      Their story was featured in the intercollegiate issue of{" "}

                      Qlipper is back to his duties as a school master and Von
                      Hemel is now working on her masters at Miami University.
                      She still sees her pal Qlipper at the barn where she works
                      part-time.

                        Gelding that came to Georgia Southern University in
                        2008. He has been used in both the Western and Hunter
                        Seat lesson program as a horsemanship horse and a lower
                        level hunter seat flat horse. He is very smart and

                        Sweet natured and very comfortable to ride, Grant’s name
                        came about because he was donated into the Make a Wish

                        After she passed away her family asked if he could come
                        to Evermore Farm, the host farm for Georgia Southern

                        Zeek is a huge part of the Purdue Western Equestrian
                        Team (PWET). PWET first met Zeek when we hired our
                        current coaches, and he quickly won over our team.
                        Whether Zeek is being ridden by a seasoned showman or a
                        first-time rider, he takes care of all of our riders.
                        Zeek is a great horse for advanced riders, but he often
                        finds himself in the beginning level lessons as he is a
                        great confidence builder and can teach a new rider a lot
                        in a short amount of time. He gives his all during every
                        lesson and competition. Zeek is a big love bug, and when
                        he is not being ridden, he takes full advantage of
                        having the team as his personal groom crew and never
                        turns down a peppermint or two! PWET loves our
                        “Zeeker-Man!”

                        Dexter is an off-the-track Thoroughbred from the Held
                        Equestrian Center at Albion College. He is the best
                        school horse ever because he can give lessons at any
                        level. He’ll keep a Walk-Trot rider safe, but can also
                        take an Open rider over a course of fences. He always
                        looks out for his rider and is the sweetest horse in the
                        barn.&nbsp;
